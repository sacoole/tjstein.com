title: About
---

I am a technology enthusiast, BBQ lover and Alabama native living in sunny Los Angeles, CA. Over the past 3 years, I have worked at an amazing company, [(mt) Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net/ "(mt) Media Temple"). Prior to joining (mt) Media Temple, I received my B.A. in Communication from Flagler College. After graduating in 2005, I became the online content manager for the [St. Augustine Record](http://staugustine.com/ "The St. Augustine Record"). I enjoy the outdoors, listening to my favorite records on vinyl and cooking with my special lady.

<h2>The Site</h2>

This is probably the seventh or so incarnation of my personal blog, an accurate reflection of my relationship with blogging platforms. This version is run on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll"), a blog-aware, static site generator written in Ruby. Posts are written in Markdown and the source will be available on GitHub eventually.
